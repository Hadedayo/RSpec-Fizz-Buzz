# RSpec-Fizz-Buzz

### Description of Fizz Buzz
A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. In this range, a number is represented as “Fizz” if it is a multiple of 3,  a number is represented as “Buzz” if it is a multiple of 5 and lastly, “FizzBuzz” is displayed if the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5.

### RSpec Tool
This is a testing tool written in Ruby to test Ruby code. The RSpec tool can be used by installing the rspec gem which consists of 3 other gems namely, rspec-core, rspec-expectation and rspec-mock.


### Summary of Testing
The Fizz Buzz program was tested using component testing to verify functioning of the different parts of the code in isolation.

** One of the test verified that the program is able to return true or false if a number is divisible by 3 and replaces the number with "Fizz".

** The test verified that the program is able to return true or false if a number is divisible by 5 and replaces the number with "Buzz".

** One of the tests confirmed that the program is able to return true or false if a number is both divisible by 3 and 5, and replaces the number with "FizzBuzz".
